## Final Year Project 

The title of my final year project is Postgraduate Practicum Management System and we have 3 subsystems : practicum hosting and placement, practicum presentation scheduling and practicum reports repository.

The subsystem that I have taken is practicum hosting and placement. This sub-system will facilitate the practicum hosting and placement processes, which include the approval/rejection from stakeholders. The company can post the hosting intention and the postgraduate students can apply for it. Applicants CVs will be kept too.
